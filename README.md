# A* Path Planning in C++

![Ubuntu Build](https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>/actions/workflows/ubuntu_build.yml/badge.svg)

A C++ implementation of the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm using OpenCV for image-based map processing.  
The planner supports configurable robot radius (map inflation), and interactive start/goal selection with the mouse.


---

## ðŸ“œ Overview

This project implements an A* path planner that operates on a binary map image:
- **White pixels (255)** = free space  
- **Black pixels (0)** = obstacles  

The program reads a binary map, optionally inflates obstacles based on the robot radius, and computes the optimal path between a start and goal position set by user via mouse on the pop up UI.
